# **Power BI Service Bookings Dashboard**

## **Problem Statement**  
The company is facing challenges in optimizing and analyzing service bookings due to insufficient visibility into key metrics such as total revenue, booking trends, time slot performance, and customer behavior.  
The lack of an effective monitoring system results in:  
- Difficulties tracking confirmed and pending bookings.  
- Challenges understanding revenue distribution across different time periods.  
- Missed opportunities in identifying top-performing services, instructors, and customers.  

This has led to missed opportunities for operational efficiency, potential revenue growth, and improved customer satisfaction.  
To address these gaps, there is a need to develop a dynamic, data-driven dashboard that can provide actionable insights and support better decision-making.
